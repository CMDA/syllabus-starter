## Description

``` 
Write the general overview of the course here. Example:

In Backend we peek behind the curtains and inspect what’s behind the web. You build web apps with Node.js, communicate with HTTP, and store data in a database with MongoDB In this course you’ll advance your web dev skills. You’ll learn to use computers to actually make what you design work: people can actually fill in forms, like things, and upload files.
```

Write about the other courses this course builds upon. Example:

Backend is an elective course given in Quarter 3 (spring) after the core curriculum of our programme, building further on knowledge acquired in *Internetstandaarden*, *Inleiding Programmeren*, and *Blok Web*. 
```

``` 
Write what students can do next after this course. Example:

This course is chosen alongside **Frontend 2** and **Project Tech**, together making up Block Tech. If you’d like to continue with web development after this course, do a tech internship, choose the Tech Track for the fall semester next year, and pick Minor Everything Web in the spring semester after that.
```
